# FLAMES - A Fun Relationship Game

## Introduction
FLAMES is a fun and nostalgic relationship compatibility game that determines the type of bond between two people based on their names. This project is implemented in **C and Java** and serves as an entertaining tool to test relationship dynamics using a simple algorithm.

## Tech Stack
- **C**: Console-based implementation
- **Java**: GUI-based implementation

## How It Works
1. The user enters two names.
2. The algorithm removes common letters from both names.
3. The remaining letters are counted and used to determine a relationship category:
   - **F** - Friends
   - **L** - Love
   - **A** - Affection
   - **M** - Marriage
   - **E** - Enemies
   - **S** - Siblings
4. The final result is displayed to the user.

##  Features
- Simple text-based input and output
- Fun and engaging interaction
- Supports multiple runs

##  Installation & Usage
### Running in C
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc flames.c -o flames
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./flames
   ```

### Running in Java
1. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac Flames.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Flames
   ```

##  Learning & Impact
- Understanding of **string manipulation** and **basic algorithms**
- Application of **control structures** (loops, conditions)
- Implementation of a **fun, interactive logic-based program**
- Ability to take real life fun to digital as Well
- This is a proccessed and well structured algorithm.
- So needn't be scared for your delulu it gives the logically correct answer!

##  Future Enhancements
- GUI version using Java Swing
- Web-based implementation using JavaScript
- Enhanced algorithm with modern relationship metrics

##  Credits
Developed by **Ananya** as a fun and interactive coding project!
